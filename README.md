# THIS IS NOT MY ORIGINAL CODE

Theme copied from [@puckzxz](https://github.com/puckzxz/)'s [NotAnotherAnimeTheme](https://github.com/puckzxz/NotAnotherAnimeTheme/) and [@ClearVision](https://github.com/ClearVision/)'s [ClearVision-v6](https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v6)

I only added a few minor tweaks here and there to meet my needs and my preferences. 

Feel free to put this in your QuickCSS if you really like it. 

<hr/>

Make sure to `ctrl h` and replace all keywords of `Beau` with the name of your private server (like you only server where you save notes and images and such for online hosting type, access from different devices, etc.). 

The channel names of the server are in the last section of the css file, just scroll through it and you'll see. 

It's recommended to replace all `Beau` with your server name in the css file, but for the channel names, you can either change the names in the css file to match your server, or change the channel names in your server/create new channel to match the names in css file. 

My channel names:

- Server named `Beau`
  - `chat`
  - `inspiration`
  - `anime`
  - `manga`
  - `tv-series`
  - `comic`
  - `movies`
  - `books`
  - `recipes`
  - `notes`
  - `games`
  - `music`
  - `guides`
  - `knowledge`
  - `resources`
  - `tools`
  - `3d-prints`
  - `secrets`
